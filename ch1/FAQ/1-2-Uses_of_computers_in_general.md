# Summary of Uses of Computers in General

Computers in education are utilized in two primary ways:  
1. **Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)**: Enhances teaching through interactive methods, simulations, and personalized learning.  
2. **Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI)**: Focuses on administrative tasks like record-keeping, test management, and resource organization.  

These applications modernize education by moving beyond traditional methods, offering dynamic tools for both teaching and learning processes.
