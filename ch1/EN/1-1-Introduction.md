# Introduction

The technological revolution is one of the most important features of this era, as it imposed itself on the world by lifting barriers between countries. There is a new language through the computer that has no borders, changing the concept of the world from closed to open, and distinguishing this era with the prevalence of information and communications, until the parties that own and produce information have power and strength.

The emergence of the computer is a result of modern technology, and due to its importance in various institutions, many specialized conferences were held in the fields of engineering, medicine, economics and education, and many issues were raised in the world about the computer and its use. Through many studies, it was concluded that the computer is a method of the era and the language of the future, and that this irrational machine only thinks at the command of the human being using artificial intelligence systems, expert systems and neural networks, which are linked to specific specifications that suit the nature of the operations that the human being wants to implement. Therefore, the computer cannot distinguish what the human being is able to distinguish from shapes and letters except through the data that the human being transmits to it. The issue was also raised recently that the computer can replace the human being, which affects his future. Many opinions in this regard saw that it contributes and helps in making sound decisions that depend, before relying on information and data, on the extent of his ability to manage and control properly, which is that ability that is derived from the experience and practical practice of the human being. We see that the computer's ability depends on its speed, and the human's ability depends on his intelligence, and thus the relationship between the human and the computer can be integrated, so that each gives his ability to the other, so the result is characterized by speed and intelligence, and makes the human quick to respond to what is around him, and thus the computer can make logical selections, as it compares one piece of information to another and tests, measures and estimates one piece of information in comparison with the other, then in light of the comparison and evaluation process, it makes the decision that determines the next step. Others see the computer as a new machine in this era that no longer replaces the strength and muscles of the human being only, but on the contrary, it has also become the role of his mind and intelligence, and just as the replacement of the human muscles by the machine in the industrial revolution in the past era led to doubling his strength, the entry of the computer into various fields, including the field of calculation and rationalization of decisions, will lead to doubling his intelligence.

This technological revolution has resulted in many successive changes in various fields, including the educational field, and science has become a special place - as old thinking does not solve new challenges at the forefront of educational development, as a result of the following challenges :-
