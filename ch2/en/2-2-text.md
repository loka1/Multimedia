# Text

Written texts mean all the written data contained on the screen that is displayed to the learner during his interaction with the program, and consists of words to convey a specific message, as written texts appear in the form of organized paragraphs on the screen titles for the main parts or to clarify the program's objectives to the learner or to give him instructions and directions about the program.

## Important Factors in Multimedia Programs

There are two important factors related to the written text in multimedia programs:

1. **Faculty**: It is related to the reader's ability to successfully identify and extract from the text what he wants, after he recognizes and distinguishes it, and the ability is measured by the speed of reading and understanding the text.

2. **Readability**: It is related to the degree of ease in interpreting the relationships that occur between the sentences of the text and its components and the ease of understanding and retrieving them, and readability is related to the ease of reading, which is the goal that is achieved by using this text or written text, and is measured by the degree of ease and comfort of the eye over a period of continuous reading.

## Reading Speed Studies

Some studies also compare the reading speed from the screen and printed materials, taking into account the size of the letters used and the style and type of letters. The study found that there is a difference in reading speed between printed materials and computers, as individuals read 220 words per minute from printed materials compared to 209 words from the computer screen, while the study found no difference between different types of fonts.

## Forms of Written Texts

Written texts take one of the following forms:

### Printing Texts
These are texts transferred to the computer via the keyboard using a word processor.

### Hyper Text
This is the process of linking texts and how to display any text, or hide and display others on the screen through the Links process between texts.

### Scanning Text
In this case, texts are transferred using a scanner as an image. however, some modifications can be made to it according to the user's needs and using appropriate programs.

## Usage Considerations

The use of this element is very important in clarifying some topics that do not depend on sound only, but the less text is used as much as possible and compensated for by using still and moving images, the better. Written texts are dealt with using the mouse, keyboard, or touching the screen with a light pen.

There are a set of considerations that must be taken into account when using texts and designing them in multimedia programs, which are:

- Ensure the learner's ability to read the texts in the program.
- Draw the learner's attention to important texts in the program by:
  - Use a thick font
  - Place the text inside a frame
  - Underline the text
  - Place the text in a large size

## Text Writing Standards

In this regard, there are a set of standards that must be taken into account when writing text in a program:

- The font size of the text is large, the amount of information on the screen is simple.
- Avoid using paragraphs and replace them with telegraphic phrases.
- Use short lines in paragraphs.
- Ensure the clarity of meaning and avoid narration.
- Place related phrases close together on the screen.
- Avoid exaggerating the text distinction, as exaggerating the distinction leads to the learner's distraction.

## Font Size Considerations

The ideal font size (letter height) as the optimal selection of the font is affected by several factors, including:

1. The size of the computer screen.
2. The pixel density of the display.
3. The user's visual capabilities. 

In general, the higher the pixel density of the screen, the smaller the font size, so the designer of the interaction interface must precisely determine the ideal display density, and then use the appropriate font size.
